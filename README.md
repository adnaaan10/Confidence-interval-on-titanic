# Confidence Interval Analysis on Titanic Dataset (Fare Column)

## Overview
This repository contains an assignment focused on calculating the confidence interval for the "Fare" column in the Titanic dataset. The confidence interval provides a range of values within which we believe the true population mean of the fare lies, based on a sample from the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the well-known Titanic dataset, which includes information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. For this assignment, the main focus is on the Fare column, which records the price each passenger paid for their ticket.

## Key Variables:
Fare: Ticket price paid by the passengers. The dataset is available on Kaggle or can be downloaded directly from this repository.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to calculate the confidence interval for the mean of the Fare variable in the Titanic dataset. This involves:

## Cleaning the dataset (handling missing values if present).
Computing the confidence interval for the mean fare. Interpreting the calculated confidence interval to provide insights into the uncertainty surrounding the fare data.

## Key Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning: Addressing any missing values in the Fare column.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculating the sample mean and standard deviation for the Fare column.

## Confidence Interval Calculation:
The confidence interval for the mean Fare is calculated using: Z-distribution: Suitable for larger sample sizes (n > 30). T-distribution: Used when the sample size is small or when population standard deviation is unknown.

## Results
The final output includes:

95% confidence interval for the Fare column. Insights into the variability and uncertainty of the fare data, providing a range that is likely to contain the true population mean fare.
